## Introduction

In this project, I developed a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline using Python and scikit-learn's `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` classes. The pipeline addresses common data challenges such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, processing textual data, and creating custom transformations. This project reflects my ability to solve complex data problems and prepare datasets for machine learning tasks effectively.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Efficiently loads the Auto MPG dataset and handles missing values.
- **Custom Transformers**: Implements custom transformers like `ClusterSimilarity` and `column_ratio` functions.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Utilizes scikit-learn pipelines for streamlined preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features through ratio computations and log transformations.
- **Text Processing**: Incorporates `TfidfVectorizer` for transforming textual data in the 'car name' column.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Applies one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Addresses and resolves common preprocessing errors and exceptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Tools**:
  - scikit-learn Pipelines
  - Custom Transformers
  - Feature Extraction with TfidfVectorizer

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-data-preprocessing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd advanced-data-preprocessing
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to execute the preprocessing pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

- Load the Auto MPG dataset.
- Apply the preprocessing pipeline.
- Output the shape of the transformed dataset.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ data
    â””â”€â”€ auto-mpg.data
```

- **main.py**: Contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, and pipeline execution.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies.
- **data**: Directory containing the dataset.

## Results

After running the pipeline, the dataset is transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models, with all features properly scaled, encoded, and engineered. The preprocessing steps ensure that models trained on this data can achieve optimal performance.

**Sample Output**:

```
Original dataset shape: (398, 9)
Transformed dataset shape: (398, N)
```

*Note: `N` represents the total number of features after preprocessing.*

# Appendices

## Appendix A: Code Overview

Here's a high-level overview of the key components in the `main.py` script:

### Data Loading

```python
# Load the Auto MPG dataset
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data'
column_names = [...]
cars = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names, na_values='?', ...)
```

### Custom Transformers

- **ClusterSimilarity**: Computes similarity features based on clustering.
- **column_ratio**: Computes the ratio of two numerical columns.

### Pipelines

- **ratio_pipeline**: Processes pairs of columns to compute ratios.
- **log_pipeline**: Applies logarithmic transformation to specified columns.
- **cat_pipeline**: Handles categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- **text_pipeline**: Processes textual data from the 'car name' column.

### Preprocessing Pipeline

Combines all individual pipelines using `ColumnTransformer`:

```python
preprocessing = ColumnTransformer([...], remainder=default_num_pipeline)
```

### Execution

```python
# Fit and transform the data
cars_prepared = preprocessing.fit_transform(cars)
print(f"Transformed dataset shape: {cars_prepared.shape}")
```
